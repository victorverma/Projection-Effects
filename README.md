This project is a fork of [griffin-goodwin/Projection-Effects](https://github.com/griffin-goodwin/Projection-Effects).
The owner, Griffin Goodwin, gave me permission to reuse and modify his code in
an email on 2025-07-22.

The original code is in the `master` branch, which is protected as it isn't
meant to be altered. In order to run the code, I needed to modify it; my
modifications are in the `main` branch.

The dependencies for this repo are listed in `env.yml`. A `conda` environment
with those dependencies can be created by running the following command from the
top-level directory:
```
./make_env.sh
```
